# help Command

The `smol help` command lists the available commands and their descriptions. Additional, more detailed help about a specific command can be shown by running `smol help <command>`. For example, to get help about the `make` command, run `smol help make` or to get help about the `make core` command, run `smol help make core`.

The provided help is generated by looking at each command's definition, so help is automatically created for any custom commands created for your project.

Help for each Core Type present in the project is also shown. For example, if you create an `express` core and a `vue` core, help for both of those will be shown. To get help for a specific core command, put the core type first: `smol help express serve`.
