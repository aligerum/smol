# What is smol

smol is a lot of things, but mainly, it's a project management toolchain for quickly and easily creating and deploying apps. It accomplishes this by:

- providing an easy to use and extend command-line interface to aid in development and can also be used by a scheduler
- breaking the app up into common use-case cores such as a frontend, api, and database
- allowing each core to be hosted and scaled independently
- providing robust configuration for easy deployment
